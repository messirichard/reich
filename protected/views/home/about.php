                        <p>The story of Reich Architectural & Interior Furnishing Hardware unfolded over three decades ago in a successful hardware appliances shop owned by the founders of Reich. We are working closely with architects, designers and builders in a fast forward modern civilisation that requires high end quality furnished doors, windows and door hardware for upscale, custom-built homes.</p>

                        <p>Looking from the opportunity that our founders sees in their daily operationals, Reich was meant to answer the need for quality furnishings, as many architects and furniture makers repeatedly asked for pieces that simply didn't exist. They were looking for accessories that would tie their projects together–products with one-of-a-kind appliances that could be used throughout the entire system to function well. Reich products are dream pieces, something outside ordinary to make those furnishing exceptional.</p>

                <div class="subtitle">
                    <p>Whenever a need arose on a project for a particular type of hardware that just couldn’t be found, the founders of Reich was simply turn that problems into a future project solution to build. Starting from the simple appliances such as wooden door hinge, the client then asked, “Can you do the glass?” Our reply? “Sure, we can do it.” The request and production evolved into such sophisticated series for the home and commercial building furnishes, then on to all the digital door knob and to hardwares in the bathroom. Next stop, door accessories and hinges, and could be plumbing and lighting. Reich will come as no surprise that the company philosophy of never saying “no” and “always embrace problem then turn it to opportunity” was the inspiration behind the creation of Reich product series. And that was just the beginning.</p>
